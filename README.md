# F1 Project

Currently, members send their predictions via WhatsApp chat to a group called “Bolão Boteco F1” After the predictions are sent, they are manually entered into a spreadsheet where the predictions are separated by each member and their respective predictions.

After the end of a Grand Prix, the classification is analyzed, and the predictions that correspond to the race classification receive the respective points that the driver indicated in the prediction earned. 

Once the calculation is complete, a table is generated with the score of each member, one table with the classification in the respective Grand Prix and one with the aggregate of all Grand Prix races to date.

The project consists of creating mechanisms to automate the calculation of predictions made by members of the “Bolão Boteco F1” betting pool.

The goal is to integrate the https://openf1.org/ API into the project's source code so that the results are calculated automatically, generating a table with the “Bolão” rankings and making the results available to members.
